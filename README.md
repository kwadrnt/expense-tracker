# Expense Tracker (in progress)

This is a personal project that I wanted to create. But here is some context.

My expenses are spread across different banking websites so it's impossible to get all my expenses consolidated in one place. In addition, I want to actually have a count of all the money I set aside for different uses without actually opening new accounts. For example, I have an account with money set aside for travel, one that keeps track of my monthly allowance, etc.

Since I started coding, I just thought it would be nice to have a better way to keep track of my expenses instead of an Excel sheet. In addition, it would be ideal to sort by categories and just look at expenses for a specific time frame.

But mainly it's to test and improve my skills and knowledge as a software engineer.

### Getting Started

1. Make sure MongoDB is installed. I like this [guide](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html).
2. Install the packages: `npm install`
3. Seed the databse: `npm run seed`
4. Start everything: `npm start`

#### Clearing the database

You can clear the database with the command: `npm run dropdb`
